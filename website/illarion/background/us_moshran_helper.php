<h1>The Three Immortal Servants of Moshran</h1>

<h2>Dragorog - The master of the evil flame</h2>

<p>This one has stolen the Dragon's eggs, and since then wears a black unholy dragon shaped
armour. He is the master of the Dark Paladins, blasphemous, dark, unholy knights. He also is the
master of many black Dragons, as far as these evil chaotic creatures can be controlled. The dark
paladins are not dead or undead, but their life force seems to be perverted and unholy. Some
Lords of the dark paladins also hire and breed whole Orc tribes and trolls. Their towns and
villages are home to many evil mercenaries and
criminals.</p>

<h2>Bjolmur - The Whisperer in the Dark</h2>

<p>Cunning, highly intelligent, and beautiful, this charming person is the mistress of
corruption. She perverts the peoples feelings, uses their hate and pain, as does her master
Moshran, but she is also a master of diplomacy, politics, and dark magic. She teaches many
necromancers and demonologists, and uses a thousand disguises to lure people from the right path
into eternal darkness. She is also the master of demons, and many demonic creatures who travel
the world in disguise.</p>

<h2>Cherass - The Undead Lord</h2>

<p>Favouring the shape of death itself, this one is a master of the undead. He is the master of
the Death Knights, strong unholy undead warriors. He also commands many Liches, other undead
mages, necromancers and spell casters. There are rumours about a few powerful vampires under his
command, but until now, none of the stories about such creatures have proven to be true.</p>
