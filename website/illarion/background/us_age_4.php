<h1>The Age of Concord</h1>

<?php cap(A); ?>

<p>fter the great battle the races started to rebuild what was left of the old world, they
spread over all the continents of Illarion.</p>

<p>The Elder Gods, being exhausted from the past battle and from the successful attempt to seal
the portals, retreated from Illarion, except Tanora who fell in love with a human called Manon
Petranor. Their offspring developed to the Lizardmen, being able to breath both water and
air.</p>

<p>Most of the mortals settled down. The memory of the great battle slowly faded, only
historians kept record of the past. As their former purpose, to defend their world, was gone,
they searched for new goals, for a new purpose. Therefore people started to choose mostly one
God to follow, who’s character and way of living suited them most. They were seeking leadership
and a goal in live, where else would be emptiness.</p>

<?php cap(B); ?>

<p>ut even though Moshran had contributed the most to their freedom, only very few people had
chosen him as their god. His mood was getting darker and darker by the year. It seemed that
another personality overtook the once admired character. He was left alone and he started to
curse the ungratefulness of all races. “They should all follow me, for I was the one who killed
their greatest enemy”, so he thought. His thoughts were dominated by hate and he vowed that one
day they would pay for their behaviour. Brágon, the Elder God, saw this and was touched by the
dark fate of Moshran. Brágon knew that some evil had partially taken control of Moshran, but
still believed that it was not too late to help him. They met, and together they created the
Orcs, to comfort Moshran in his loneliness.</p>

<p>Made with fire, and infused by the anger of their God, the Orks quickly spread chaos wherever
they appeared. Their unpredictable nature and their lust for war and new territories put them in
conflict with the other races, thus provoking the anger of the remaining Younger Gods. But since
there were many honorable warriors coming from that race too, the creation was not changed or
undone.</p>

<p>Thus ends the Age of Concord and begins the Age of Discord.</p>
