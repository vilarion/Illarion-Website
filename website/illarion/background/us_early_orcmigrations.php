<h2>-2,678 until -2,612: The Initial Orcish Wars</h2>

<p>The warlord of the Dragonclaw Clan, Tuchak Bloodfist, takes over the leadership of
the clan with some intrigues and several murders. He names himself the warlord over all
orcish kin. He has the eldest of the other two major clans (Wolfmoon and Firefist)
murdered and replaces them with warmongers loyal to him. In the following rebellions and
insurrections, Tuchak Bloodfist is slain, and the three major clans split up into five
(Bloodfist, Nighthawk, Howling Wolf, Waraxe, and Bloody Skull Clan), as well as some
several minor ones.</p>

<p>The Bloodfist Clan, which consists of former followers of Tuchak, is driven away by
the other four clans and begins to wander. Now led by Krugg Bloodfist (a younger brother
of Tuchak), the clan robs and loots two settlements of the plainfolk humans. In the
following years, the Bloodfist Clan presses on into civilized territory, and scouts of
the orcs report of the city of Albar.</p>

<p>Krugg was astonished by message of a fortified settlement of such a vast size and
knowing the Albarian army was closely following his tracks, the leader of the Bloodfist
Clan withdrew and sent four messengers to the four other major Clans. These deny the
Bloodfist any support though. The Bloodfist ist nearly wiped out. In order to save his
clan from annihilation, Krugg sacrificed thirty captives and himself in a blood ritual.
Shortly thereafter, a giant horde of monsters led by a demon decimates the Albarian
army. The rest of the Bloodfist Clan withdraws in the meanwhile to the security of the
borders to the orcish territories.</p>

<p>The message of demon's magicks, monsters, and bloodthirsty orcs spreads quickly in
the cities of mankind. Salkamaerian paladins hire mercenaries to support their former
enemy city of Albar, and the new legion quickly finds further support in the Serinjah
tribes. The Bloodfist Clan is wiped out and scattered. The human army advances deeply
into the orcish territory and builds a row of fortified outposts along the Draikon
river. Along the course of centuries to come, attacks against the orcish clans are lead
from here onwards.</p>

<h2>-2,608 until -2,495: The Orcish Crusades, Beginnings</h2>

<p>After the flight from their original hunting grounds, the four orcish clans migrate
from the Serinjah plains over the continent for several centuries. Famine and several
wars massively decimate the orcish clans during their migration, and they are nearly
completely wiped out.</p>

<p>Only by the year of -2,495, they discover unsettled, fertile lands.</p>

<h2>-2,588 until -2,579: The Second Orcish Wars</h2>

<p>In the forests of Eldaril, the Howling Wolf Clan encountered the elvenkind. These
elves had been maintaing trade relationships with the Plainfolk humans. Thus, they head
heard rumours of the orcs, who supposedly stood in alliance with demons. They considered
this thesis as confirmed by the hunters of the orcs having (unknowingly) trespassed into
their sacred grounds, and having tarnished the latter with the blood of slain animals.
The Howling Wolf Clan was quickly driven out of the forest. The elves applied
exceptional precision in the task-the archers used magic arrows in order to mortally
wound with their first strike and spare their enemies of any suffering. If that had not
been enough already, the archers also used magic in order to remain unseen.</p>

<p>The orcish clans gathered and did council.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, the orcs returned and set a widespread fire to the forest
borders. It took several weeks until the quickly-spreading fire was completely
extinguished. A humongous woodland range and three towns of the elvenkind were victims
to the flames, and those survivors set aghast were captured by the orcs moving up upon
the following eve. According to orcish tradition, the most severely wounded captives
were sacrificed to the Gods in gratitude for the victory-due to the lack of any other
foodstuffs, they were eaten.</p>

<p>Merely three days later, still in the middle of victory celebrations, the encampment
of the orcs was attacked. Numerous elves had appeared, clad in weapons and armour from
times of ancient wars and such that were crafted to follow the footsteps of ancient
arts. Elven magic cast breaches into the orcish battlements, and while the captives took
their flight, wardancers and bladesingers already lept into the midst of the stupefied
orcs. It took only little time until the stupefaction of the orcish warriors transformed
into a wild escape: There was nothing to set against an enemy that moved supernaturally
fast, could hurl blaze and lightning, and would appear in the middle of their own rows.
Nearly half of all the present orcs were slain immediately during this surprise attack.
Because the elves had counted their losses as well, they decided against chasing the
escapees, and instead decided to wait for reinforcements and honor the fallen.</p>

<p>The eldest of the Waraxe Clan decided to distance himself as far as possible from the
elven territory, because first of all a war was unnecessary and secondly the tribes were
weakened by famine and battle and would not withstand the foe. The Howling Wolf Clan
followed this decision, while the Nighthawk Clan wanted to continue doing battle. The
Bloody Skull Clan decided to send negotiators with gifts to the elves. None of the
parliamentaries ever arrived.</p>

<p>In the following ten years, there were several skirmishes between orcs and elves,
while the eldest debated over how to deal with the situation. The orcs had been so
weakened by the years of wandering that they posed no grand threat, however, they had
learned to craft and use the bow and blade. This debate went on for centuries.</p>

<h2>-2,562: Insurrections in Albar</h2>

<p>A rebellion of peasants and farmers rises in Albar. After whipping and executing the
rebel leaders, the insurrections end in the defeat of the rebels.</p>
