<h1>The Age of Discord</h1>

<p>Despite Brágons hope, Moshran had never abandoned his vow to repay the hostility towards him.
In secrecy, Moshran created three immortal beings. He gave immense powers to these creatures and
taught them much knowledge, but he also bound them to himself in many ways. He named them
<a href="us_moshran_helper.php">Dragorog, Bjolmur, and Cherass</a>. Moshran bred them to almost god-like
powers.</p>

<p>Driven by the unbearable need to gain more power, Moshran searched for the remains of the
once mighty army of Madrook Na’han. He found them, hidden in deep caverns, and was accepted as
their leader, for they recognized the power and voice of their former master. Demon-like
creatures, eyeless beasts and unspeakable horrors, he bred and released them upon the mortals,
even upon the Orcs.</p>

<p>He started to expand his influence areas against the protest of the other Gods. For the first
time, his three followers took open action, and started to conquer land and people without
respecting other God's realms. Moshran managed to cut off Tanora's power over some few
waters in his lands, until Tanora recognized it and protected all other places. Zhambra, Irmorom
and Malachín tried to talk with Moshran, but he laughed at them, and called his three followers
and a horde of monsters and corrupted animals to battle them. After a long fight against four
strong enemies, Zhambra, Irmorom and Malachín had to retreat.</p>

<p>People from other races, mainly humans but not only, pledged loyalty to Moshran, as every
time, might and success had it’s followers. Moshran was able to spread mischief between the
races. Prejudice and hate against other races were bred. Mistrust against the “others” was
risen.</p>

<p>While the other Gods discussed what should be done, Moshran's hordes started to build
strongholds and outposts under the surface, and from there covered the lands with terror. The
other Gods decided to strengthen some chosen mortals, and to train them in fight against the
undead and monsters. The different races now started to defend themselves against Moshran's
creatures with amazing efficiency. In the long wars from there on, many new strong Runes were
researched and created by mortal magicians.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Brágon realized his mistake, and returned from the world he had gone to. And with
him, he brought some of his creatures: noble, mighty Dragons. As he recognized the situation and
saw the lands covered in war, he offered his support to the other Gods to restore order. In long
battles and with the help of Brágon's Dragons, Moshran's hordes were pushed back. Much
lost territory was regained, but at the cost of many lives on both sides. In a final big battle,
Moshran's three helpers had to flee when Malachín defeated their master. In this battle, the
surrounding lands were shattered, and destroyed by the raging powers. In the same time, one of
Moshran's followers along with a troop of demons managed to steal some eggs from one of
Brágon's Dragon breeds.</p>

<p>The continents were devastated in these wars and in the final battle, leaving the islands
around to be the only places where people could live. After that, all Gods, including Moshran,
swore an oath never to fight against each other personally any more.</p>

<p>Even after his defeat, Moshran was still convinced that it was his right to be the only
master of the world and all beings. So the other Gods imprisoned and chained him in a cell, far
below the surface, deep under the earth, hoping that some day he would return to his old self.
But before they left him, they took the armour and the sword of Madrook Na’han away from him.
Tanora took the cursed armour into her water-realm, and promised to hide and seal it well. As did
Elara with the sword. It was evident, that without these artifacts, Moshran would be unable to
regain the evil power he once controlled, and would most likely loose the evil influence.</p>

<p>After the wars were over, and the three followers of Moshran have retreated to unknown
places, Brágon left Illarion again. But recognizing the theft of the eggs, he gave Dragon eggs
to Tanora, and to some of the Younger Gods too.</p>

<p>Thus ends the Age of Discord and begins the Age of Isolation.</p>
