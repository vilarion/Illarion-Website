<h2>Fragment of the lost chronicles of the Manrok Order: </h2>

<p class="center">
	Fire, the world is fire!<br />
	<br />
	It's burning in his heart, and filling him with pain,<br />
	It's giving him the warmth of terror in reign.<br />
	<br />
	Breathing the mortals heat, draining from mortal soul,<br />
	To fill him with their warmth and make his life be whole.<br />
	<br />
	He drinks the heated blood, essential taste of life<br />
	It rushes in his veins, gives him the madman's drive.<br />
	<br />
	Slipping into living flesh, gliding into the brain<br />
	Playing there with thoughts and will, to keep a steady drain.<br />
	<br />
	Fire, the world for sure is on fire!<br />
	<br />
	He's walking through the flames, they greet him in anticipation<br />
	Expecting him to build his own dark doomed creation.<br />
	<br />
	Destruction he will spread, in seeking his old treasure<br />
	The pain his arm will bring, will be without a measure.<br />

<h1>The Age of Isolation</h1>

<?php cap(E); ?>

<p>ven though Moshran was imprisoned deep inside the earth, his foul intentions prosper on the
surface, as after the wars with him, the races preferred to stay amongst their own kind. Most of
the old great cities and many other places formerly inhabited by people of all races were
destroyed, none of them do exist anymore and no one attempted to rebuild them. Mistrust between
the races existed everywhere.</p>

<p>In the meantime, some races fought each others. The Younger Gods solved conflicts amongst
each others by smaller, tactical wars and endless discussions, but never raised a hand against
another God anymore.</p>

<p>The continents grew plants and many animals again, but until now, very few people lived
there.</p>

<p>A hundred years later, the chained Moshran escaped from his cell, with the help of someone
from outside. But his three helpers swore that they had nothing to do with it. Rumours spread
that it was Narg√πn and Cheerga, who broke his chains. Their intentions, if any, are still
unclear.</p>

<p>Since then, the world stays in an uneasy peace, as the God of Blood and Bones again walks in
the lands of Illarion. Moshran, well hidden most supposedly by his three helpers, now starts to
seek after the powerful artifacts, his sword and armour. He expect that they will help him to
regain his once great power.</p>

<p>Thus ends the Age of Isolation. Only the future will show us our destiny.</p>
