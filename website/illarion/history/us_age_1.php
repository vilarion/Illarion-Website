<h1>The Age of Legends</h1>

<?php cap(S); ?>
<p>inora Maldrán, Mother of Wisdom, proclaimed in the prime age of Shilawén: "The day will come when darkness covers the land. Darkness, arisen from within us, strengthened and nurtured by us, but which eventually will dominate us. Then the black abyss of oblivion will engulf us and our folk will return to dust. But a small seed of ourselves will escape to flourish again in another world, prospering with the strength we have provided."</p>

<p>As her last words faded away she broke her crook as a sign of sacrifice. Her lifeless body fell to the ground and the force within her found a new vessel. Only a sealed scroll fell with her body as a reminder of a past world.</p> 

<p>The true origin of the Elder Gods of Illarion remained shrouded in mystery. The world they once knew was shattered by conflict as their own kind vied for dominance. Perhaps sent to preserve the true essence of their own existence, to harness greater power for the final battle, to form a stronghold, or for some other unknown purpose... it matters not, our world was created.</p>

<p>Known history began with the <a href="us_age_2.php">Age of Dawn</a>.</p>
