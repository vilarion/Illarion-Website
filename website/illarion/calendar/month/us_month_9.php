	<h2>Month of Trade</h2>

<p>Irmas is named after Irmorom, god of craftsmanship and trade. From the 1st to the 8th Irmas, Galmair celebrates a great festival with parading craftsmen and merchants. In Cadomyr, a less raucous feast of craftsmen and merchants is also celebrated from the 1st to the 4th Irmas. Every big city across Salkamar, Gynk and Albar also has the largest market day of the year during Irmas. The dwarven kind of Sevenhill host a competition for crafters called The Golden Hammer, which starts on the 12th Irmas. Contests for different crafts are held over three to four days; the five days after are for celebrating and drinking while another good part of the month is necessary to sober up again.</p>
