	<h2>Month of Blood</h2>

<p>Mas, the shortest of all months, was named after Moshran, the god of blood and bones. The month of blood is feared to bring great misfortune across all of Illarion and other civilised realms such as Albar, Salkamar and Gynk. Whilst mercenary gangs might use the days as an excuse for wild drinking and scuffles, some orc tribes celebrate the blood days as Radosh. The month is welcomed with joy and obeisance, before the orcs succumb to the ecstasy of wild and boisterous fighting. Huge caves are lit with torches and fires, and ceremonial fights are held; it is a common belief that many disputes and quarrels are solved in these fights. Generally these fights remain ceremonial and do not end too bloodily but in some of the least civilised tribes the warriors still "slay each another in heaps".</p>

<p>The wildest of tribes are still thought to perform sacrifices - rarely captives from other tribes and races, but more often volunteers from their own tribe who give themselves to the sacrificial dagger. It is rumoured that these tribes believe such a death is the greatest honour to bestow on a warrior as they will be reborn with Moshran's blessing in a strong body. This custom, as well as the rites of "slaying each another in heaps" has become very rare, because the loss of a good warrior or hunter usually causes any tribe great hardship. Generally, animals are now slaughtered and sacrificed to the gods and ancestors before being consumed during the evening feast.</p>

<p>For many orcs, the days of Mas are also a memorial to one of their greatest leaders in history, Drokan Norotar. He is highly honoured as the hero and martyr who united the peaceful tribes of orcs and gave the orcish people a voice amongst all other races. Neighbours of his realm did not trust his peaceful intentions, however, and under the cover of negotiations he was trapped and murdered. The young realm broke apart and what followed brought much suffering to the orcs. The Flame-orcs see Drokan Norotar as a prophet who brought peace and civilisation to the wild tribes. Although not a Flame-orc himself, some of his writings had a great influence on their culture. There is even a prophecy saying that a second Drokan Norotar, or even his reborn soul, will soon again reunite the tribes. In memory of him, the wild tribes of the orcs smear ash into their face and cut their hands and scalps with daggers, signifying how Drokan Norotar was beheaded and had his hands cut off. With their faces covered in blood they chant dirges and elegies over the full five days of Mas.</p>

<p>In other races this feast has the more symbolic tradition of sacrificing a small animal, usually a chicken or rabbit, without many words. This is done in an attempt to calm Moshran, preventing wars and other bad luck. Usually there is no prayer, just a silent gesture. After the sacrifice, the people stay in their homes and hope that the Mas passes quickly without incident, so they can welcome a new year in.</p>
