	<h1>Adras</h1>

	<h2>Month of Intoxication</h2>

<p>Adras, the month of intoxication, was named after Adron, the god of festivities and wine. A tavern feast is celebrated in Galmair from the 3rd to the 7th Adras and vintage festivals are held in many villages across Illarion. Even in Cadomyr there is a wine feast from the 17th to the 19th Adras, during which all citizens, even serfs and bondsmen, are allowed to drink copious wine and even get drunk, something usually restricted to the upper class. In rural Albar, nobles traditionally give out cheap wine in the taverns for free during these days. A story tells of a greedy Count who once watered down this wine for the poor and how he was struck by Adron's curse. Every drop of wine that touched his lips changed into water until he paid back for his lack of generosity tenfold.</p>
