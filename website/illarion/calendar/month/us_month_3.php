	<h2>Month of Loyalty</h2>

<p>Zhas was named after Zhambra, god of friendship and loyalty. The month of Zhas is a very busy time for peasants and farmers around Runewick and Galmair, working the fields after the replenishing waters of Tanos. Zhambra is a major god of the Salkamaerian pantheon and some towns in Salkamar celebrate a poetry-festival during Zhas, possibly inspired by an elven celebration. On the 12th of Zhas they celebrate a memorial called the "Day of the Cherry Blossom", to remind that nothing lasts for eternity. Elven legends tell of the division and fall of an elven house bearing the name of "Narnil" and the descendants of this house, the "Erume-Lie". Well known is a translation of an ancient elven song from the libraries of Nanuk Moonsilver:</p>

<p><i>"To the river I went alone,<br />
Water to bail.<br />
All around me delicately fell<br />
The leaves of the cherry blossom.<br />
With graceful ease they glide away,<br />
In their dying beauty.<br />
The water carried away the white splendor,<br />
My heart to follow.<br />
Freezing, the empty branches shiver<br />
I am freezing in the wind."</i></p>
