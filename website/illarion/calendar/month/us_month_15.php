	<h1>Chos</h1>

	<h2>Month of Commemoration</h2>

<p>Chos was named after Cherga, the "Grey Mistress", who collects the souls of the deceased and brings them into the world on the other side of death. Dark and cold winter days remind people of their vulnerability and sickness strikes more readily. Many living in areas where it snows are unable to farm and depend on supplies gathered during the year. Even in the warmer south of Illarion where snow is extremely rare and in some places completely unknown, Chos is a time for reserved living and commemoration of the dead. Almost all races, people and creeds hold a memorial day to remember the deceased during Chos. Followers and priests of Cherga often hold ceremonies in well-heated chapels within cemeteries.</p>
