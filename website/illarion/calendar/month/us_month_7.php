	<h2>Month of Immolation</h2>

<p>Brás is named after Brágon, the third known creator god who brought the sun and fire to the world. Once known as the month of immolation, sacrificial burning is rarely practiced in Illarion these days. The longest day in the year, followed by the shortest night falls on the 24th of Brás. During this night elves celebrate the Feast of Fire, and small, carved pieces of wood carrying many candles can be seen floating on many lakes and rivers. Humans celebrate the month somewhat differently with long feasts held in Salkmar and Gynk where all kinds of artists demonstrate their skills. In Albar just the nobles tend to celebrate with their decadent feasts lasting through the whole of Brás. It is not unusual for there to be a special tax enforced in many Albarian regions to finance this.</p>
