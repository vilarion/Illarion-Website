		The elegant Falcon
	</h1>

	<h2>Month: Findos</h2>

<p>Falcons are full of bold beauty and attract a lot of spectators. They are creative and inventive with obvious flair. Artistically talented, they love music, painting, and other arts. Many varied wishes slumber under their thin shell of reason and as a result they may seem flighty. An elegant Falcon tends to be very curious and sometimes impertinent - they can afford to be. They might be fickle, but one thing they will never be is boring.</p>
