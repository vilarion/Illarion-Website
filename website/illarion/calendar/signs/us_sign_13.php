		The willful Mule
	</h1>

	<h2>Month: Adras</h2>

<p>Ecstatic festivals and good wine are the preferences of those who are born in the sign of the willful Mule. They are sociable, humourous, and straight-forward types but may be melanchonic when things don't happen in their favour. Talented musicians and bards, particularly the renowned entertainers of the elite, are often found to be born during Adras. Many a raucous drinker with their less refined tavern songs are also found amongst their numbers. Despite all the positive traits of being a Mule, they tend to be reckless about the feelings of others and can be self-centred, prone to speaking their mind regardless of their company. Due to unknown, mysterious circumstances, the Mules are by far the most common birth signs throughout Illarion.</p>
