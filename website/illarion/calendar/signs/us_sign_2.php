		The dreaming Dolphin
	</h1>

	<h2>Month: Tanos</h2>

<p>Dolphins often appear to be melancholic. They tend to dream of goals they cannot possibly reach and continuously quarrel with their fate. Typically they are also very calm, just, and possess good taste. They constantly seek the vicinity of their beloved and strive for attention and approval. Dreaming Dolphins are not the preferred companions of everyone, as they tend to be sad or worried. Those who are impatient will never understand the ways of a troubled dreaming Dolphin.</p>
