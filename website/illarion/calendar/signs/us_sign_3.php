		The pride Lion
	</h1>

	<h2>Month: Zhas</h2>

<p>Those born of the month of Zhas generally exhibit great reliability. Friendship is highly valued and Lions commonly seek comradeship with those who they can truly trust, forming close bonds that often last a lifetime. They are sincere and honourable with often righteous traits which may lead them to live as knights or paladins. To have a loyal Lion as a friend means you have a companion throughout your entire lifetime who will unwaveringly stand by you but will not hesitate to remind you with an honest word should you depart from a just cause. Steadfast Lions are resolute in their reason and belief in consequence, with those less disciplined prone to suffer under their inference. To betray a Lion draws immense wrath and appeasing them once angered is not so easy.</p>
