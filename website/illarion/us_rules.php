<h1>Illarion Game Rules</h1>

<?php Page::cap('O'); ?>
<p>n this page you can find all the rules and procedures that apply to the game Illarion.
They should cover most situations in Illarion. In case of doubts, contact a
Gamemaster. They know the rules by heart, and can help you when conflicts or
questions arise. The most important principle in Illarion though is:</p>

<p><b>We play with, not against each other.</b></p>

<p>People who play Illarion and follow this principle can
hardly do anything wrong. </p>

<p>We are an open and tolerant community.
Harassment, threats or insults, including racist or sexist statements against other players will
not be tolerated. This hold for all platforms of Illarion: The game, the board
and the chat, including private messages.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<?php Page::cap('R'); ?>

<p>ules are important to create a good roleplay atmosphere, but no rules can describe how players should behave towards one another. This code of conduct forms a set of guidelines to show the kind of game climate and culture we would like to create in Illarion, where players are respectful, considerate and lenient with one another.</p>

<p>Illarion is a true roleplaying game. Your character is not your avatar in
another world and his gain and loss is not yours. Separate yourself from your
character and let him have flaws and commit mistakes. Players commit mistakes
once in a while, too. Be lenient towards the mistakes of other players, nobody
is perfect, not even you. If you cannot stand the behaviour of another player,
leave him alone and contact a Gamemaster. Have faith in the fact that no one
wants to harm your fun on purpose, likewise, you must not want to spoil anyone's
fun. Consider whether everything you do in game is also fun for other players or
just for you alone.</p>

<p>Illarion is based on cooperative playing, even if characters may be foes, the
players shall continue the tale of Illarion hand in hand. To battle each other
is in vain, this holds for the Illarion staff, too. It consists of volunteers
that manage a free game in their spare time, without being perfect, just like
you. Respect and common courtesy are as important as good communication;
a helpful word commonly has more effect than a thousand complaints.</p>

<p>The staff
does its share to shape the world of Illarion, but the major share is done by
the players. The tales and adventures in the game as well as the way of
communication on the boards and in the chat are influenced by players just like
you. Please contribute actively to maintain an atmosphere of respect and
considerateness that attracts roleplayers from all around the world.</p>

<div class="clr"></div>

<div><a id="account"></a></div>
<h2>Account</h2>

<p>The recommended minimum age for players of Illarion is 16 years. This limit
has been set, because players need to be able to deal with the themes and
content within the game with a certain maturity.</p>

<p>Every player is allowed only one account. Accounts and characters are not borrowed, 
exchanged or sold. The owner of an account is responsible for all actions of his characters, 
even if an unauthorised person got access to it.</p>

<p>If two players want to log in using the same internet connection, 
they have to inform the Illarion staff about this.
</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="names"></a></div>
<h2>Names</h2>

<p>Names of characters have to fit a mediaeval fantasy world and the race of the
character. In addition, the following types of names are not allowed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Absurd and offensive names (Kismai Ass, Adolf Hitlersson)</li>
  <li>Names of history or present-day life (Barack Obama, Julius Caesar)</li>
  <li>Names of mythology, religion etc. (Buddha, Jesus Christus, Osiris)</li>
  <li>Well known names from literature, TV, movies etc. (Gandalf, Legolas, Harry
  Potter, Mononoke)</li>
  <li>Names containing a title (Sir Yaran, King Kuno). You can earn titles in the game</li>
</ul>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="world"></a></div>
<h2>The game world</h2>

<p>The description of the game world as published on <?php echo Page::getURL(); ?> is mandatory. 
The races allowed to play are limited to the races offered to choose during the character 
creation in the account system. It's not allowed to roleplay any mixed-race characters.</p>

<p>
A Gamemaster's permission is needed for all magical and divine interventions as well as
supernatural properties that cannot be realised by the engine and affect the game world or
other players.
</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="realism"></a></div>
<h2>Realism</h2>

<p>Regardless from the limits and possibilities of the engine, one has to adapt
the behaviour of a character to the game world. Swords remain deathly weapons,
ogres are still scary monsters and farming hard labour, even if the engine
allows a player to master such challenges. It is not allowed in the sense of the
game logic to ignore NPCs in your own roleplay. No criminal would rob another
character right in front of a town guard, even if the guard is only a NPC.</p>

<p>Actions of a character must not be adapted to the technical environment of
the engine to maximise success. Characters have to react on external influences
and must not be kept idle in the game. To evade unwanted situations that could
have bad consequences for a character by logging out of the game is
forbidden.</p>

<p>When a character is knocked down or 'killed', (s)he will suffer from injuries
which should be played out. In case of a knock-out there are light injuries, in
the case of death severe ones. The wounds should be played out until the health
points are fully restored.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="charmixing"></a></div>
<h2>Mixing characters</h2>

<p>In general it is not allowed that two characters of one player support each
other. Therefore it is forbidden to exchange items between characters, also not
by using middlemen, and that they share knowledge. One's characters also can't
know each other and cannot be related. It is not allowed at any time to log in
with two characters at the same time.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="ooc"></a></div>
<h2>Out of character (OOC)</h2>

<p>Out of character is everything that is not backed up by actions or thoughts
of a character in-game. Decisions or actions in game should never be motivated by
OOC influence, e.g. because of dislike for the other player. To call for help
via means, not present in the game (e.g. messengers), is strictly forbidden. It is
also not allowed to use knowledge which the player has but the character
doesn't. A player has to prove that the character has gained said knowledge.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="language"></a></div>
<h2>Language of characters and emotes</h2>

<p>The language should fit the character and the game world and should follow
the rules of spelling and grammar as well as possible. Modern expressions as
well as abbreviations or "Leet-speak" (e.g. "u g0t pwn3d") should not by 
used.</p>

<p>Writing or invoking senseless or disturbing messages and the continuous use
of capital letters to stress statements (e.g. "IT IS MY TURN NOW!") is not
allowed.</p>

<p>Conversations are to be done from the point of view of the character.
Conversations that have nothing to do with the communication between the
characters (OOC), are to kept to a bare minimum and have to be masked by double
brackets (( )) in whisper mode.</p>

<p>Action of characters (e.g. fighting, crafting) should be
accompanied by emotes. Emotes describe only perceivable actions and states.
Emotes do not contain opinions, thoughts or feelings of characters.</p>

<p>So called power-emotes that force a behaviour or an effect on other
characters and leave no room for reaction are forbidden.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="behavior"></a></div>
<h2>Behaviour in the game</h2>

<p>Content and portrayals of actions which are brutal, perverse, sexual or
glorify violence are strictly forbidden. Also all contents that hurt the ideals
and moralities of involved players and random listeners are not allowed.</p>

<p>It is not allowed to react to a rule violation of another player with another rule violation 
(e.g. OOC-messages). These breaches will be dealt with, regardless of the situation. 
It is unwanted for players to rebuke each other for rule violations. If a rule violation
 occurs, the Illarion staff should be informed to process the case.</p>
 
 <p>The purposeful attacking of a character without clearly traceable and
reasonable roleplaying reason is forbidden. Immediate killing of a character
right after resurrection ("res-killing") is not allowed.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="forum"></a></div>
<h2>Forum and Chat</h2>

<p>On the Forum and the Illarion Chat, common netiquette are applicable. Full quotes, off-topic posts, illegal, offensive or disturbing (e.g. gore, violence, nudity) posts and links are prohibited. Do not use alternative accounts (sock puppets) to support your statements. Do not post for the sake of causing unrest (trolling, flaming, ranting). Continuation of locked threads or replying to very old threads (grave digging) is forbidden.</p>

<p>Discussions on features or events of the game shall always be constructive and include a proposal for improvement. Complaints about other players or rule violations shall be <a href="<?php echo Page::getURL(); ?>/community/us_contact.php?contact=3">reported to the staff</a> and must not be discussed on the forum. Likewise, complaints about staff members shall be reported to the <a href="<?php echo Page::getURL(); ?>/community/us_contact.php?contact=4">Illarion Society Board</a>.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="bugs"></a></div>
<h2>Bug exploits</h2>

<p>The wilful use of game errors (bugs) is, regardless of reason, forbidden. If
an error is found in-game, it has to be reported to the Illarion staff;
preferably by an entry in the bugtracker. If items or effects are lost due to a
bug or server crash, there is no replacement or refund.</p>

<p>The usage of programs which influence the behaviour of the game and thus
offer an advantage to the player are not allowed.</p>
