   <h1>Illarion Society</h1>
  
   <h2>Support Membership</h2>
   
<?php Page::cap('I'); ?>

<p>llarion is a free game that is maintained by volunteers.
No one gets a cent for their work at Illarion, but still the hosting of the server costs
money. The money needed for this is paid by the members of the Illarion Society.</p>

<p>The simplest way to cover our expenses in a predictable way is your Illarion Society support 
membership for only ten Euro per year. To become a member, just fill out the form and send it to us. 
Please find the Illarion Society statutes below.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><a href="Illarion_e.V._-_Request_for_Support_Membership.pdf">Support Membership Request for &quot;Illarion e.V.&quot; Society</a> (pdf)</li>
	   <li><a href="Illarion_e.V._-_Statutes.pdf">Illarion e.V. - Statutes</a> (pdf)</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Because both sides should have a benefit, we thought about advantages for those members. 
   As a fundamental idea we don't want to offer any in-game advantages, 
   because this would be just a premium game account for people who are able to pay.
   The following benefits are available for support members on <a href="<?php echo Page::getURL(); ?>/community/de_contact.php?contact=25">request</a> right now:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Your own forwarding email address to your specified account email address (e.g. charactername@illarion.org)</li>
      <li>Increase of the maximum character number for your account from 5 to 7</li>
      <li>A guild forum at forum.illarion.org with group leader and moderator rights</li>
   </ul>

   <p>This list could be changed at any time, we already have more ideas. There is no redress in law to get these benefits.</p>

<h2>Donations</h2>
<p>To ensure that we can keep the server online in future the Illarion Society is in need of donations.
As alternative to a donation there is also the possibility to

e.V</a> and help the Illarion Society with ten Euro yearly membership fee.</p>
