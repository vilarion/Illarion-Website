<h1>Development Progress</h1>

<p>Illarion's development follows clearly specified work packages. Those work packages stand for a state of the game that does not require any future reworking on existing features. Hence, only improvements and new features will be added without fundamental flaws or bugs. The work packages are worked on in parallel and not in sequence. This pages orders them in the predicted sequence of completion, though.</p>

<p>If you want to help to develop Illarion, please contact one of the <a href="<?php echo Page::getURL(); ?>/community/us_contact.php#4">developers</a> or join the <a href="<?php echo Page::getURL(); ?>/community/us_chat.php">chat</a>.
